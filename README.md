## ‚≠ê Using Node.ts

### Setting up repository

To get started, first generate your new repository. There are two ways to do this:

1. [Generate a repository with Node.ts template](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/node.ts/generate) is GitHub's preferred way
2. [Import this repository](https://github.com/new/import) keeps the commit history, which you may want

### Updating `README.md`

Make the following changes to this `README.md` (note that these changes are **case-sensitive**):

1. Replace "Node.ts" with your project name
2. Replace "AnandChowdhary/node.ts" with your GitHub "username/repository"
3. Replace "@anandchowdhary/node.ts" with your npm package name
4. Replace "@anandchowdhary%2Fnode.ts" with your npm package name, [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI)

### Updating `package.json`

Make the following changes to `package.json`:

1. Replace "@anandchowdhary/node.ts" with your npm package name
2. Change the version to "0.0.0" for Semantic Release to take over
3. Replace the description with your npm package description
4. Replace "AnandChowdhary/node.ts" with your GitHub "username/repository"
5. Replace "Anand Chowdhary <mail@anandchowdhary.com>" with you as the author
6. Replace "anandchowdhary.github.io" with "username.github.io"

### Last steps

1. Add your npm token (`NPM_TOKEN`) as a GitHub secret in your repository ([more details](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/recipes/github-actions.md))
2. Log in or sign up on [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) and [add your repository](https://coveralls.io/repos/new)
3. Remove this section ("Using Node.ts"), keeping the "Usage" section below
4. Replace "AnandChowdhary/eject-dependencies" with your GitHub "username/repository" in `.releaserc.json`
5. [Set up GitHub Pages with `master` branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source)
6. Write commits messages using [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me)
